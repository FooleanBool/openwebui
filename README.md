This repository serves as a public and private store for my OWUI tools, scripts, and functions. It's a collection of utilities designed to enhance the functionality of the [openweb UI (OWUI)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui).

## Current Tools

This repository contains three action functions:

1. [ComfyUI Workflow Loader](functions/actions/comfy_workflow_loader/README.md) - Loads and applies ComfyUI workflows to Open WebUI, preserving all workflow settings and configurations.

2. [Quick Image Config](functions/actions/quick-image-conf/README.md) - A simple tool for quickly updating image generation settings using shorthand commands, perfect for rapid adjustments to model, steps, and dimensions.

3. [Quick Voice Config](functions/actions/quick-voice-conf/README.md) - A simple tool for quickly updating voice settings using shorthand commands, perfect for rapid adjustments to voice, speed, and auto-playback settings.

## Getting Started

To use these tools, you're assumed to have a working installation of [openweb UI (OWUI)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui). Each individual tool/script will have its own instructions within its respective directory.

## Contributing
