# OWUI Tools & Scripts

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository serves as a public and private store for my OWUI tools, scripts, and functions. It's a collection of utilities designed to enhance the functionality of the [openweb UI (OWUI)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui).

## Current Tools

As of now, this repository contains a single action function: `comfy-workflow-loader`.  This function will list and load comfyui workflows stored in a designated knowledge base.

## Getting Started

To use these tools, you're assumed to have a working installation of [openweb UI (OWUI)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui).  Each individual tool/script will have its own instructions within its respective directory.

## Contributing

Feel free to use these tools as-is.  If you have suggestions or encounter issues, please open an issue in this repository.
